# code-golf

This (very much unfinished) repo is meant as an excercise in GitHub workflows.
Eventually, pull requests will be automatically approved or rejected depending on whether
the PR solution to an included task is valid, is Black formatted, and is shorter than the current solution.
This is not yet implemented.
